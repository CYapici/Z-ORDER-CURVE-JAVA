# ZOrderCurve
Z ORDER CURVE AKA MORTON ORDER IMPLEMENTATION JAVA 
Bit operations of Z Order Curve needs Uint unsigned primitive, the UINT32 class in this project is not a primitive but it synthetically
works like a primitive unsigned type. 
I did not test performance . But I saw there is not much difference than C++ when encrypting numbers smaller than 10 digits.
In million or thousnd thereshold i estimate that ehere will be great performance difference because of the factors stated above.
